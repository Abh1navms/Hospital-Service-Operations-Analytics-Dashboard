# 🏥 Hospital Service & Operations Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive **hospital operations and capacity analysis dashboard** built to help hospital management understand **patient demand, staff performance, bed utilization, and emergency department efficiency**.

The dashboard is designed from a **business + healthcare operations perspective**, focusing on **capacity planning, service bottlenecks, staff efficiency, and patient experience**.


## 🎯 Business Objectives

* Monitor **hospital capacity vs patient demand**
* Identify **bed shortages and service-level bottlenecks**
* Evaluate **staff attendance, morale, and satisfaction**
* Analyze **emergency department performance and refusal rates**
* Track **patient satisfaction trends** against defined targets

---

## 🧩 Dashboard Structure

The solution consists of **three analytical views**:

1. **Hospital Service & Capacity Dashboard**
2. **Staff & Operations Analytics**
3. **Emergency Department Performance**

Each page answers a specific business question.

## 1️⃣ Hospital Service & Capacity Dashboard

### Key KPIs

* **Requested Patients:** 13K
* **Admitted Patients:** 5,851
* **Staff Attendance %:** 60% (Target ≥ 90%) ❌
* **Bed Utilization %:** 92.7% (Target ≥ 85%) ✅

### Key Insights

* Bed utilization is **critically high**, indicating capacity pressure.
* Staff attendance is **well below target**, impacting admissions.
* Emergency and ICU services show **higher demand and admission rates**.

### Visual Analysis

* **Weekly Bed Demand Gap vs Capacity:** Highlights weeks where demand exceeds available beds.
* **Admission Rate by Service:** ICU and Emergency have higher admission shares.
* **Demand vs Outcomes by Service:** Emergency shows the highest refusals.
* **Weekly Patient Satisfaction Trend:** Satisfaction fluctuates with demand peaks.

## 2️⃣ Staff & Operations Analytics

### Key KPIs

* **Staff Attendance %:** 60% ❌
* **Average Staff Morale:** 72.57 (Target ≥ 75) ❌
* **Total Staff:** 110
* **Average Weekly Satisfaction:** 80 (Target ≥ 85) ❌

### Key Insights

* Lower staff attendance correlates with **reduced patient satisfaction**.
* Emergency staff show **higher workload and attendance pressure**.
* ICU has relatively lower morale compared to other services.

### Visual Analysis

* **Staff Attendance by Service:** Emergency has the highest attendance demand.
* **Average Staff Morale by Service:** ICU shows lowest morale score.
* **Staff Role Distribution:** Balanced mix of doctors, nurses, and assistants.
* **Morale vs Satisfaction Scatter:** Positive relationship between staff morale and patient satisfaction.

## 3️⃣ Emergency Department Performance

### Key KPIs

* **Total Emergency Requests:** 6,193
* **Emergency Admitted:** 1,185
* **Emergency Refused:** 5,008 (Target ≤ 50) ❌
* **Emergency Admission Rate:** 19.13% (Target ≥ 30%) ❌

### Key Insights

* Emergency department is **severely overloaded**.
* High refusal rates are driven by **bed shortages and staffing gaps**.
* Admission rate remains consistently below target.

### Visual Analysis

* **Weekly Emergency Requests vs Admissions:** Large gap indicates capacity constraints.
* **Emergency Beds by Week:** Limited bed growth despite rising demand.
* **Refusals vs Target Line:** Refusals exceed target in most weeks.
* **Emergency Satisfaction vs Goal:** Satisfaction drops during peak refusal periods.
